# Configure the LFS system

## Network configuration

You will also need an identical wireless configuration if your system requires a wireless connection. See `man systemd.network` for a detailed description of all the configuration options. This is enough to enable internet over both IPv4 and IPv6 when connected to a network with a DHCP server (which is the typical home setup). If building Linux From Scratch in a VM and attached to some sort of default NAT network, the host your VM is a guest on will serve as a DHCP server unless you are attached to some internal private network you set up yourself, in which case you likely already know what you are doing.

```sh
cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/network/10-ethernet.network
[Match]
Type=ether

[Network]
DHCP=yes
IPv6PrivacyExtensions=yes
DNSOverTLS=yes
MulticastDNS=yes

[DHCPv4]
RouteMetric=512

[DHCPv6]
RouteMetric=512
EOF

ln -sfv /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

Optional wireless config:

```sh
cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/network/20-wlan.network
[Match]
Type=wlan

[Network]
DHCP=yes
IPv6PrivacyExtensions=yes
DNSOverTLS=yes
MulticastDNS=yes

[DHCPv4]
RouteMetric=1024

[DHCPv6]
RouteMetric=1024
EOF
```

## Configure hostname and hosts file

```sh
echo "lfs" > /etc/hostname
cat > /etc/hosts << EOF
# Begin /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
::1       localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1   ip6-allnodes
ff02::2   ip6-allrouters

# End /etc/hosts
EOF
```

## Configure time

```sh
cat > /etc/adjtime << EOF
0.0 0 0.0
0
LOCAL
EOF
```

## Configure locale

It is up to you how you want to configure the locale. Every locale available in `glibc` was built, so there is no need to create them. Simply set the necessary variables. The following are my personal preferences:

```sh
cat > /etc/locale.conf << EOF
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8
LC_COLLATE=C
EOF
```

## Configure readline

```sh
cat > /etc/inputrc << EOF
# Begin /etc/inputrc

# do not bell on tab-completion
set bell-style none

set meta-flag on
set input-meta on
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on

# for linux console and RH/Debian xterm
"\e[1~": beginning-of-line
"\e[4~": end-of-line
"\e[5~": beginning-of-history
"\e[6~": end-of-history
"\e[7~": beginning-of-line
"\e[3~": delete-char
"\e[2~": quoted-insert
"\e[5C": forward-word
"\e[5D": backward-word
"\e\e[C": forward-word
"\e\e[D": backward-word
"\e[1;5C": forward-word
"\e[1;5D": backward-word

# for rxvt
"\e[8~": end-of-line

# for non RH/Debian xterm, can't hurt for RH/DEbian xterm
"\eOH": beginning-of-line
"\eOF": end-of-line

# for freebsd console
"\e[H": beginning-of-line
"\e[F": end-of-line

# End /etc/inputrc
EOF
```

## Configure shells

```sh
cat > /etc/shells << EOF
# Begin /etc/shells

/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/bin/zsh

# End /etc/shells
EOF
```

Change default shell to `zsh`:

```sh
sed -i 's/\/bash/\/zsh' /etc/default/useradd
```

## /etc/os-release

Normally, `Linux From Scratch` does not include this file, but some packages will expect it to exist in order to get information about the installed system. Notably, if you decide to install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, the recommended way to do it uses a tool called `ghcup` that relies upon this file at least existing. It doesn't have to recognize the distro, but will throw an exception if the file does not exist at all. So we will create one:

```sh
cat > /usr/lib/os-release << EOF
NAME="Linux From Scratch"
PRETTY_NAME="Linux From Scratch"
ID=lfs
BUILD_ID=rolling
ANSI_COLOR="38;2;23;147;209"
HOME_URL="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/"
DOCUMENTATION_URL="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/support.html"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/submit.html"
LOGO=linuxfromscratch
EOF

ln -sfv ../usr/lib/os-release /etc/os-release
```

## Configure users

Ensure root cannot login and change default shell to `zsh`:

```sh
passwd -l root
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

Create a non-root user and set a passwd:

```sh
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/zsh lfs
passwd lfs
```

Login as this user and you will go through `zsh` setup:

```sh
su lfs
```

Afterwards, set the prompt and colorize the `ls` command:

```sh
echo "autoload -U colors && colors" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "PS1=\"[%(#.%F{red}.%F{cyan})%n%f@%F{cyan}%m %1~%f]%(#.#.$) \"" >> ~/.zshrc
eval dircolors >> ~/.zshrc
echo "alias ls='ls --color=auto'" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Copy the shell init file to `root`'s home:

```sh
sudo cp /home/lfs/.zshrc /root
```

Feel free to set this up how you like. This is simply what I prefer.

## Configure ssh keys

At this point, you'll want to add any public ssh keys you wish to use to login to your new user's `authorized_keys` file. If you have keys stored in GitHub, the easiest way to do this, from outside the chroot:

```sh
sudo su -
mkdir -p $LFS/home/lfs/.ssh
wget https://github.com/${USER}.keys -O $LFS/home/lfs/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Then, from inside the chroot:

```sh
sudo chown -R lfs:lfs /home/lfs/.ssh
chmod 750 /home/lfs/.ssh
chmod 640 /home/lfs/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
